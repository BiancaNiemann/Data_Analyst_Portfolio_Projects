# Atlas-Labs-HR-Analytics

##### In this HR Analytics case study from Datacamp, I explored data from a fictional company called Atlas Labs. 
##### Using Tableau, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and created calculated fields to build impactful visualizations that highlight key workforce trends.

#### Key Findings:
* Atlas Labs has hired a total of 1,470 employees since inception.
* Currently, 1,233 employees are active, with 237 former employees, resulting in an attrition rate of 16.1%.
* The Technology department is the largest by far.
* The majority of employees fall within the 20â€“29 age group, indicating a younger, dynamic workforce.
* Sales representatives have the highest attrition rate at 39.8%, while Engineering managers have the lowest at just 2.7%.
* 44% of the employees are married.

##### After completing the Atlas Labs HR Analytics case study on DataCamp, I decided to reinforce my learning by practicing some of the key insights using SQL. I used commands such as SELECT, COUNT, GROUP BY, and COALESCE to query the database and replicate the data displayed on my Tableau dashboard
